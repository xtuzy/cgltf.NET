# cgltf.NET

[cgltf.NET](https://github.com/xtuzy/cgltf.NET) is c# port of [jkuhlmann/cgltf](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf). 

When I was using stbimagesharp, I found that I could convert C's single-file library to C#, so when I needed a glTF library, I wondered if there was such a library. I found cgltf, which is the result. The conversion code I wrote is rough and untested, and I don't want to put a lot of effort into maintaining it because it's a conversion, and spending too much effort on maintenance is less efficient than using p/invoke. I will try it in my 3D project, and if it works, I will try to optimize it in the future.
